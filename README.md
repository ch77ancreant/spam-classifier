# spam-classifier
The dataset `emails.csv` is obtained from kaggle. Here is the link:\
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/balaka18/email-spam-classification-dataset-csv

I used three methods to construct the model, DNN of Tensorflow, DNN of PyTorch, and SVM of scikit-learn.\
At the bottom of the Jupyter Notebook, we can write down the email and use our pre-trained model to predict whether the email is spam.
